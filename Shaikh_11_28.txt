The logic of authentication.

Summary: 
	The paper provides a formal method/language to analyze authentication protocols. The approach used to analyze  
authentication protocols includes summarizing the initial assumptions in the form of trust of principals and initial  
awareness of keys. Once these requirements are listed the verification of the protocol entails proving some basic formulas as  logical conclusions to the protocol step (augmented by the initial assumptions).


Highlights of the paper. 
1. Describes a formal language/notation to describe the basic actions in a authentication protocol. Such formal notation  
allows for stronger protocol verification as its (mostly) devoid of ambiguities. 
2. Table 1 summaries subtle nuances between then existing authentication protocols. If the table is a result of their  
verification procedure then it very commendable (but may be the listed characteristic of those protocol we already known).
3. The analysis of the then existing Kerberos implementation, proves the importance of the analysis method described by the  
author. The analysis method points out a redundancy in step 2 of the protocol. 

Deficiency of the paper.
I think the author wrongly concludes that Kerberos has a redundant double encryption. From my understanding I believe  
Kerberos does the double encryption so that ticket request to the server cannot be masqueraded.

Learning for future.
We can analyze and verify new authentication algorithms using the message meaning, nonce verification and jurisdiction  
postulates. (But for that we need to understand the postulates really well).
