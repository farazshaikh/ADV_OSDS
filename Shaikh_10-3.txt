Log-Structured File System
MENDEL ROSENBLUM and JOHN K. OUSTERHOUT
University of California at Berkeley


3 Most Important Points.
-----------------------
a. Random,small and synchronous blocks are detrimental for file systems. The solution is that filesystems should try for sequential,large asynchronous transfers. 
b. Presens good methods for doing filesystems performance analysis. For example the Uniform-hot and code test pattern along with write-cost formula can be used to  compare any filesystem.
c. Throws light on the order of operations to be performed when creating new files 
	-write the data-block, then
	-make the inode block and then 
	-link to the parent directory
   This makes the recovery possible in crashes after step 2.
d. Cleaner policies can affect overall performance gains of a log structred filesystem.


Deficiency of Paper. 
--------------------
More on disk structures should have been explained and drawn. The paper becomes very abstract because of the number of disk structres being used.


Learning.
---------
Blocks size should while formatting disk should be large enough so that it offsets the seek time. One should avoid random small and synchronous disk accesses.
