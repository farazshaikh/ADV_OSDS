Byzantine Generals Problems. 

Summary
The paper describes the problem of distributed concensus in presence of byzantine failures. These failure are not of type of fail stop nature, rather no assumption is made about the behaviour of the failed node. The failed node is free to act as it pleases. 

Three Important Points about the paper.
1. Describes names and formally introduces the problem in term of IC1 and IC2. 
2. Intuitively describes that there exist no solution for the case of 3 generals with 1 traitor.
   2.a. Using 2 proves that there is no solution to the problem if 1/3 or more generals are traitors. (For any N generals)
   2.c. Also shows that even reaching approximation is hard.
3. Describes a solution in more that 2/3 generals are loyal. This is recursive solution based on trivial case of no traitors i.e m=0 and recursion of m>0. In presence of digital signature/unforgeable messages author describes the existence of a solution for the three general problem. 

Deficiency About the paper:
   Although the author tried to make the paper interesting by attaching a story to it. Lamport is as cryptic as he can get. He suffers from having a habbit of using double negetives to describe things.

Learning. 
1. Systems can tolerate BFT only in presence of less than 1/3 node failures.
